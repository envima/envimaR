#' Initialise a project
#'
#' \code{prInit} should be used in a Rstudio project. The function creates
#' the basic structure of a data analysis project that will help you keep your
#' your work organised and increase your productivity.
#'
#' @param dir Directory where project files will be stored. By default, it is
#'   the current working directory.
#' @param instructions Should instructions added in the scripts created by the
#'   the function?
#' @author Francois Guillem
#' @details
#' The function creates three folders :
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item scripts: Folder where the scripts are stored
#'   \item data: Folder where the source and intermediate data files are stored
#'   \item output: Folder where the output of the project are stored
#' }
#'
#' These three folders are essential so do not remove them. But you can add any
#' other folders you desire ("latex", "presentation", etc.)
#'
#' Additionally, three scripts are created:
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item main.R: This is the main script of your project. Ideally, just by
#'   looking at this script you should remember how your project is organised
#'   For small projects most code can go in this script. But for larger project,
#'   it should mostly contain comments what each script is supposed to do. You
#'   can use the function \code{\link{prScript}} to programatically open the
#'   scripts you are referring to.
#'
#'   \item data.R: This script should contain inscruction to import data in the
#'   project and/or transform the source data in processed data that will be
#'   studied/analysed. As for the script "main", for large project, this script
#'   should not contain code, but make reference to the scripts that do the job.
#'
#'   \item start.R: script that is executed every time the project is opened. It
#'   should load the packages used in the project, define constant values, ...
#'   More generally it should include all technical instructions that do not
#'   directly participate to the creation, manipulation or analysis of data.
