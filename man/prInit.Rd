\title{Initialise a project}
\usage{
prInit(dir = ".", instructions = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dir}{Directory where project files will be stored. By default, it is
the current working directory.}

\item{instructions}{Should instructions added in the scripts created by the
the function?}
}
\description{
\code{prInit} should be used in a Rstudio project. The function creates
the basic structure of a data analysis project that will help you keep your
your work organised and increase your productivity.
}
\details{
The function creates three folders :

\itemize{
\item scripts: Folder where the scripts are stored
\item data: Folder where the source and intermediate data files are stored
\item output: Folder where the output of the project are stored
}

These three folders are essential so do not remove them. But you can add any
other folders you desire ("latex", "presentation", etc.)

Additionally, three scripts are created:

\itemize{
\item main.R: This is the main script of your project. Ideally, just by
looking at this script you should remember how your project is organised
For small projects most code can go in this script. But for larger project,
it should mostly contain comments what each script is supposed to do. You
can use the function \code{\link{prScript}} to programatically open the
scripts you are referring to.

\item data.R: This script should contain inscruction to import data in the
project and/or transform the source data in processed data that will be
studied/analysed. As for the script "main", for large project, this script
should not contain code, but make reference to the scripts that do the job.

\item start.R: script that is executed every time the project is opened. It
should load the packages used in the project, define constant values, ...
More generally it should include all technical instructions that do not
directly participate to the creation, manipulation or analysis of data.
