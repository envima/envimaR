\usage{
prLibrary(..., warnings = FALSE)
}

package is missing, the function tries to install it from CRAN by defaults.
If a package needs to be installed from github, it can be declared with the
following format: \code{"github:username/pkgname"}. This way, if the
package is not installed yet, the function knows how to install it.}

}
\description{
The function tries to load all packages passed as argument. For those that
are not installed, it tries to install them and then load them.
