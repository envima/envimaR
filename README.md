# envimaR
Helpers for setting up working environments which focus on using the same 
initialization parameters across different computers and team members. 

## branch merge_tiny_Project

The branch merge_tinyProject integrates the slightly modified ``tinyProject'' package by Francois Guillem (guillem.francois@gmail.com).  Basically, it is intended to evaluate the functionality and to integrate it more strongly if necessary. The ``envimR`` package provides more specific project structures even for complex working environments while ``tinyProject`` supports a good mapping of the project workflow and a consistent working method.
