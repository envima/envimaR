#--- NOTE
# In this file, you should the code that imports data and prepare it for
# analysis.
#
# Objects created by this script should be saved with 'prSave' and loaded with
# 'prLoad' either at the beggining of your other scripts or in script 'start'.
#
# If the operations performed here take a long time, you may also want to save
# intermediary objects with 'prSave' so they are not lost in case of error or
# crash.
#
# Finally if this script becomes too large, you can split your code in multiple
# scripts and create a link to them with function 'prScript'.

#--- INPUT:
# what is the source data ?


#--- OUTPUT:
# what data objects will the script create and whatfore?


#--- DETAILS:
# Anything else ? Where did you get the data ? Did you do some manual
# transformation ?
