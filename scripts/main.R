#--- NOTE
# This is the main script of the project. It should contain all the information
# necessary to understand the goal of the project and the different steps of 
# your analysis. 
#
# It should not contain data manipulation code or long technical blocks of code
# because they tend to hide your statistical reasoning. 
# - data code should go in script 'data'.
# - technical code should be written as functions and should go in scripts
#   contained in a subfolder "tools" (use prScript("tools/function_name")) to
#   create them). Scripts in this folder are automatically sourced at startup.
#
# For small projects, statistical analysis of your data should be performed in
# this file. For larger projects, you should put your analysis code in other
# scripts and describe here what each script does. You can create a link to them
# with function 'prScript'.
